# TheGamingRoom


> Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    
The Gaming Room needed the development and deployment of an existing mobile game, Draw It or Lose It, to a hosted web-based application to increase user base.  Cross-platform compatability was essential.
    
> What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Analysis of the systems architecture.

> What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Understanding the needs of the client and the requirements for API implementation.

> If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The evaluation section.  I was confused by the table for server side, client side and development tools.

> How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

If an application does not meet the client's agreed upon requirements, then the project should be considered an overall failure.

> How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I require a far better understanding of back-end coding, as I have practially zero experience in this.  However, being familiar with Java helped me to successfully build code that worked.  Also, I had no prior knowledge of the libraries and toolsets required for the projects, so utilizing them was difficult.
